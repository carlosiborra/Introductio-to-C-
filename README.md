# 2. Introduction

## 2.1. What is C++?

> C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".

## 2.2. Why C++?

> C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.



# 3. Basic Concepts

## 3.1. Headers

> In C++ offers varoius headers, which ares used to make programs work correctly. They are defined at the top of the cpp file.

Example of use:

```cpp
# inlcude <iostream>
```

Link to all headers:

[C++ Standard Library headers - cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header)

## 3.2. Namespaces

> A namespace isÂ **a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. They are used below the headers.**

Example of use:

```cpp
using namespace std;
```
